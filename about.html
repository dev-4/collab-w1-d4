            <p>
                Volcanos are sacred spaces, spaces of terrible destruction but as Hawaiians have long known - the land grows from it as well. Volcanic soil is prized for how it creates life - from taro to wild boar, life grows after an eruption. We here at Save The Volcanoes want to educate the world on the awesome power of nature and teach people to respect both its descriptive capabilities and be in awe of its life bringing powers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We teach communities and schools all about volcano safety and what to do when lava is coming (run).
            </p>
            
            <h2>What is our goal</h2>
            <p>
                Are goal as a self run community is to advocate that volcanoes be allowed to explode as often as they want. To ofter in this modern day and age are volcanoes being forced to hold it in. As a famous ice-witch once said "just let it go". We here are V.E.F.inc take this quote very seriously and strive everyday to encourage volcanoes all around the world to bust their caps.
            </p>
